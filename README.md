# Express/Quasar Task Manager App
## by [Dan Almenar](https://linkedin.com/in/daniel-almenar-williams)

This project is a basic **Task Manager** App (*a.k.a. ToDo App*) built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for the backend and [Quasar](https://quasar.dev) for the frontend. It also integrates with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for auth and data storage. The codebase is written with **Typescript**.

A fairly simple project but it will allow users to log into their accounts and create tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them from any device, since tasks will be stored in the cloud (firebase/firestore).

Please note that **this is not the only README.md file you'll find across the project**. Both the backend and frontend folders have their own README.md, as so do the customTypes, composables, middleware and every other folder I consider requires one.

**Note:** This project is still in development and is not yet ready for use.

### About .gitignore
Some folders and files has been added to the .gitignore list and will remain flagged as untracked while development. Other files and folders will be ignored by git and will be kept red flagged even after deployment. On every case, files and folders that are flagged while development will be announced on their respective README.md files, for instance, the */middleware/firebase* folder contains its own README.md file which explains the module and lists the files that has been temporary or definitively added to the .gitignore and the reasons why.

**One last note:** If this repo is in any way useful to you, please consider give it a star.

### Thanks!
